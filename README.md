# pomo
A minimalistic pomodoro app

## Description
pomo is a simple, yet effective pomodoro app, that doesn't occupy too much screen space.

By default, the app runs "Always on top" meaning that it will always be visible over other applications. The feature to toggle it off is in the roadmap.

I decided to develop pomo because I was not satisfied with other pomodoro apps, due to the fact that they offer too many features, have big layouts and don't always stay visible on screen.

## How to install
Mac: Download the latest stable release, unzip it, enable third-party applications on the System Settings, right-click to open, right-click to open again. Move it to the Applications folder. Enjoy.
