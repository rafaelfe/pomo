# pomo
A minimalistic pomodoro app

## Description
pomo is a simple, yet effective pomodoro app, and doesn't occupy too much screen space.

By default, the app runs "Always on top" meaning that it will always be visible over other applications.

I decided to develop pomo because I was not satisfied with other pomodoro apps, due to the fact that they offer too many features, have big layouts and don't always stay visible on screen.

## How to install
Tested on macOS Catalina: 
* Download the latest stable release [here](https://github.com/rafaelfe/pomo/releases/download/1.0/pomo.macOS.v1.0.zip).
