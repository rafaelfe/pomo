# pomo
A minimalistic pomodoro app

## Description
pomo is a simple, yet effective pomodoro app, and doesn't occupy too much screen space.

By default, the app runs "Always on top" meaning that it will always be visible over other applications.

I decided to develop pomo because I was not satisfied with other pomodoro apps, due to the fact that they offer too many features, have big layouts and don't always stay visible on screen.
